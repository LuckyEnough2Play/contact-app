Calling Method (Phone/Third‑Party)

- Choose a default calling method in Settings > Calling: "Ask every time", "Phone (system)", plus FaceTime (iOS) and Skype when available.
- When set to "Ask every time", tapping a call icon shows a chooser to place the call with the selected app.
- Fallbacks: If a chosen app is unavailable, the app falls back to the system phone using `tel:`.

Notes
- iOS restricts third‑party calling; FaceTime and Phone are most reliable. Skype works when installed.
- Android uses the system dialer by default; selecting Skype opens Skype if installed.
